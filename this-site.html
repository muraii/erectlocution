        <p>I've been tinkering in the dark abyss that is offline computing for years, really, trying to come up with a site implementation that manifests a synthesis between my creative batshittery and some approximation of information and UX design. I have been failing, but I feel like I'm close to failing less grossly.</p>
<p>There are bits you'll see here that aren't right. The alignment of posts on the home page (<em>shudder</em>) is goofy because I don't have a static width set for the date element. Block quotes are rendered uglily [sic]. It doesn't scale like I want for mobile, which was actually one of the things I wanted to accomplish.</p>
<p>But here it is, this site, and I guess we'll all just have to be patient.</p>
